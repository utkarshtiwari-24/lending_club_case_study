## Conclusions
- Years 2008, 2009 and 2010 has the highest default rates, which is understandable as the World was going through an economic crisis and therefore has the maximum defaulters.
- In Home Ownership category - OTHER has the most default percentage.
- People running small businesses are more likely to default with the highest default percentage of 25% and major purchases and weddings have the least percentage
- People with grades E,F,G are more likely to default as compared to other grades. 31% people with Grade G are likely to default. Sub Grades - F5, G3, G2 have the most default percentage and therefore more likely to default.
- We can also imply that the loan amount, funded amount, the funded investor amount, interest rate, and their dti is greater for the defaulted people than those who have fully paid the loan whereas defaulted people's annual income is less than those who have fully paid the loan.
